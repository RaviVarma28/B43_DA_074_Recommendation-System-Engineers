Features
Web Scraping: Scrape medical research articles, news, and COVID-19 data from platforms like PubMed, WebMD, and Medscape.

Data Cleaning: Clean and preprocess scraped data to remove duplicates, irrelevant content, and formatting issues.

Trend Analysis: Analyze trends in medical treatments, disease outbreaks, and healthcare technologies using SQL and Python.

Data Visualization: Create interactive dashboards in Power BI/Tableau to visualize trends and insights.

Sentiment Analysis: Perform sentiment analysis on healthcare news articles to gauge public sentiment.

Keyword Extraction: Extract and analyze top keywords from medical research articles.

Design Decisions & Assumptions
Web Scraping:

Assumed that scraping is allowed for the target websites (e.g., PubMed, WebMD).

Used BeautifulSoup and Selenium for scraping dynamic content.

Data Cleaning:

Assumed that the scraped data contains noise (e.g., HTML tags, duplicates) and requires preprocessing.

Used pandas and spaCy for cleaning and preprocessing.

Trend Analysis:

Assumed that trends can be identified by analyzing the frequency of keywords, entities, and topics over time.

Used SQL for querying and Python for statistical analysis.

Visualization:

Assumed that stakeholders prefer interactive dashboards for exploring trends.

Used Power BI/Tableau for creating visualizations.
